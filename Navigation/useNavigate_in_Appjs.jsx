  REACT ROUTER PLACEMENT RULES:
  
  1. INSIDE <Router> BUT OUTSIDE <Routes>:
     - Components that appear on EVERY PAGE
     - Examples: Navbar, Header, Footer
     - They get routing powers but don't care about URLs

  2. INSIDE <Routes> (via <Route>):
     - Components that are PAGE-SPECIFIC
     - Examples: Login, Dashboard, Profile
     - They only appear when their URL matches
*/
