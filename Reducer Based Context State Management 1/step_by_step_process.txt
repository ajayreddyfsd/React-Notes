✅ Reducer-based Context (useReducer) – Overview

Create an INITIAL_STATE object — a single object holding all related state pieces

Define ACTION_TYPES — a set of clear string constants representing how state can be updated


Write a reducer function:
Accepts (state, action)
Uses switch (or if) to return a new state based on action type


Inside the provider:
Use const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(...)
Write helper functions that dispatch actions
Pass everything into value
Provide the value via <Context.Provider value={value}>
