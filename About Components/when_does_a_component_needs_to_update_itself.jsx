// A React component needs to re-render or update itself when:

// 1. Its state or state variables change via setState (class) or useState (functional)
// 2. Its props change because new values are being passed
// 3. Its parent component re-renders (which may cause this child component to re-render too)
// 4. You force it to re-render using forceUpdate() (rarely used)
